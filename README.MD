# Catastrophe Manager

## Summary
This if my first attemp to learn how shared memory works within O.S, primary focused to Linux systems (and checked in Arch Linux distro)

The main idea behind this is to aim mi progress into SICE, a partner company of CAPITOLE CONSULTING, since I'm gonna work there the next month.

## How works
Composed by two different programs:
- Generator
- Solver

The first, generates differente catastrophes into a shared memory readed by the second program, Solver, that will fix them.

Both programs are CLI programs, so you need to enter the correct commands to handle the catastrophes!

## Commands
Both programs have unix-like opparams.

<code>
v --verbose   : Print all operations to stdout
</code>
